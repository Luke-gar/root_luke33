      <h2>
        for this project i ended up doing 2 diffrent models becuase of a mess up
        on my part in addtion, I somewhat turned into a I.T man in the group
        whenever any problems arose.

          First try, with was my first attempt at a model to be very honest I
          loved this one a lot more, however, due to the topology it was a mess
          and I scraped it

          Back view... fun fact, becuase I was so concerned about topology I
          ended up remeshing the entire model by hand after sculpting it.

          as you can see with the concept art its a little far from the orginal
          concept, but i think i kept some core elements, such as the hair and
          type of clothing
