    <p class="about1">I’m a student at vainer college in the multimedia program with the hope of becoming for lack of a better word a manga author and artist in the future in order to share my perspective with the world through an awesome fantasy land I have been working on for the last five years.  while I work to that Goal I hope to become a video game concept artist or create 3d models for video games, even web developing would be interesting, i hope this program will open many doors for me.</p>

    One of my largest interests is
    Anime, black clover being my absolutely favorite.
   As childish as it may be this show what helped
   me through my lowest point in life.

    My Third largest Interest is exercise or physical well being. With coming back to school my workout schedule is a little messed up but I hope to get back into it soon; luckily I do run frequently so it keeps up my health.
