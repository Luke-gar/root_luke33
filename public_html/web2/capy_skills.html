        S: I currently am able to keep track of what i have to do on my own, however it is disorganized and causes me stress, less then 10 percent of my projects are incomplete and i let my teachers know when i need extra time. however, i want to be able to use a task management system to reduce stress conisistantly send in my work on time and intergrate more feedback from my peers and teachers better.
