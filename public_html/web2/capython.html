        <p>
          one may be asking what a capython is? my teachers at Vanier college
          decided to run a sort of hackathon/project week. within this week firt
          years, second years and third years would all work togehter in order
          to create a project to the best of their ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          so for this capython we decided to create a google event page, where
          people can futher learn about indigenous communities we went about
          this by createing a 3d model of a isle with grayscale models of items
          associated with cultural significance. once the user would press on
          the greyscale models it would play a video that we animated, edited
          and modeled within the week explaining the significance of these items
          in their culture.

        <p>
          so during this project, I created some of the models for the isle,
          created a single character, and basically made and set up the isle
          that you see in the home page, i also created some background elements
          but it was uneeded in the end so we scraped them.

          So in general i feel that the main issue that our group had was
          communication. In general our group had a hard time working togehter
          since 1 thrid years barely showed up which I can understand at the
          same time due to the fact that they have their intership, however, I
          was kind of annoyed since the third years when we first met completely
          ignored me and the other first years. As time went on communcation
          with them slowly got better though. 2nd, one of the members didnt show
          up much and
