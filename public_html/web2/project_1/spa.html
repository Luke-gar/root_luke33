          This is a website for my project at vanier college. The goal for this
          website was to be able to demonstrate my capabilites and understanding
          with html, css, javascript and general conceptual design. I went about
          this by utalizing animations shown to me in class along side
          javascript. The content that I chose to fill the website was a
          walkthrough on how to draw.

            As a way of gathering my thoughts on what I was looking for in
            desgin for the website I found these 3 websites:
           <a href="https://www.icelandicexplorer.com/">icelandicexplorer</a>
           <a href="https://neal.fun/deep-sea/">neal deepsea</a> 
           <a href="https://rewildyourself.com/"> rewildyourself</a>. It may not be exact, but I fell in
            love with the infinite scrolling, and a lot of the fading in
            animations.

            As for most of my Inspieration, I believe when we have alot of
            freedom like in this project our hobbies tend to come out and show
            themselves. in this case i'm aware of how much of a superfan I am of
            anime and art so i drew Inspieration from a manga i have read named
            vagabond and a trend online called hopecore. as a way of hopefully
            incouraging younger artists to continue on their path.

        learning how to draw a mix of 2d and 3d shapes can improve your art
        drastically, it allows you to learn more line movements and how things
        connect. To start off you might want to start with basic 2d shapes like
        squares and circles, later experiment with 3d shapes and as a last step
        start to create unique shapes through mixing diffrent shapes following a
        similar process

        Learning perspective is one of the harder things about art and drawing,
        however, once you understand a basic idea of perspective it can
        drastically improve your art allowing to create more depth in all your
        drawings. Once you have mastered shapes, it would be a good idea to go
        back to the begining and start experimenting with vanishing points you
        can find online and following the lines to the vanishing point to create
        something of depth

          One might think they have to go to greate lengths to try to learn
          perspective and in some cases it might just not stick with the person,
          in this case one of the things that i would suggest is to improve your
          line quality, alot of time new and old artists have a habit of having
          very rough lines, which at times makes it hard to understand if that
          isn't what you are going for. At the same time however, these rough
          lines can add movement depending on how they are utalized, same with
          thick and so on, the idea is that their is a billion things you can
          explain with jsut line thickness and the way you move the stroke of a
          tool. To start I suggest looking up exerises to help your hand eye
          cordination and practice a bunch and experiment with it all.
